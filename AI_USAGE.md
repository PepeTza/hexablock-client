# AI Usage

How the team uses generative AI in this repository, as required by section 7
of the project statement. The team is responsible for all delivered code,
whether or not it was AI-assisted, and must be able to explain any part of it.

## 1. Tools

| Tool | Model / version | Role in the workflow |
|---|---|---|
| Claude (claude.ai) | Claude Opus 5.5 | Requirements analysis, business rules, use cases, domain model, API contract, repository documentation. Consulted for design options; decisions are taken by the team. |
| Claude Code | To be recorded per entry | Implementation of approved tasks through the harness (`harness/`). Writes code and tests under human approval at each gate. |

Add a row when a new tool is used.

### Template

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Task]

- **Tool / model:**
- **Issue / PR:**
- **Prompt (literal or faithful paraphrase):**
- **Result:** what the AI produced (code, design, explanation).
- **Team modifications:** what was changed, rejected or corrected, and why.
- **Lessons / limitations:**
```

### 2026-11-04 to 2026-11-10 — Pre-implementation documentation

- **Tool / model:** Claude (claude.ai), Claude Opus 5.5.
- **Issue / PR:** initial repository skeleton.
- **Prompt (paraphrase):** review the project statement and the team's draft;
  detect inconsistencies; propose and refine requirements, business rules,
  use cases, the DDD model, the class diagram structure, the API contract,
  contribution rules and this repository skeleton, one piece at a time and
  explaining new concepts.
- **Result:** technical document (requirements, rules RN-01..43, use cases
  CU-01..18, user stories, DDD model, decisions), API contract,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the harness and templates.
- **Team modifications:**
  - Business rules corrected by the team (e.g. Hexa Fit score based on moves
    and time, relocation counted as one move, levels immutable and only
    appended).
  - Seed configuration moved to an admin panel after clarification with the
    professor.
  - The AI first proposed squash-and-merge; it was replaced by rebase-and-merge
    because squash would erase the granular, per-author history the statement
    requires.
  - The team chose composition (`Board<TCell>` with an injected geometry)
    among the options presented.
- **Lessons / limitations:** the AI tends to propose more classes and patterns
  than needed; the team keeps only what it can justify. Diagram import into
  Lucidchart lost generic type parameters and had to be fixed manually.

### 2026-11-11 — Implementation plan and I0 issues

- **Tool / model:** Claude Code, Claude Opus 5.5.
- **Issue / PR:** #13.
- **Prompt (paraphrase):** read both repositories' docs and propose, as a
  gate 1 plan only, the iterations until 2026-12-14, a work split in three
  tracks, the issues, labels and milestones, the folder structure, the setup
  task, how to use agents and skills, and the decisions still open.
- **Result:** the plan now in `docs/implementation-plan.md`; the 15 issues of
  I0 (client #3–#12, backend #3–#7).
- **Team modifications:**
  - The first split gave Hexa Lines and Hexa Merge to one track and both
    level-based variants to another, leaving one member without a variant.
    The team required every member to own at least one variant; the split was
    redone.
  - The AI proposed creating all 83 issues, milestones and a GitHub Projects
    board at once. The team chose to create issues per iteration only, with
    no milestones and no board.
  - A separate progress file was proposed and dropped: `harness/phase-log.md`
    already records completed work.
  - The plan was written in Spanish for the team and translated to English
    for the repository; track letters were replaced by the members' names.
- **Lessons / limitations:** the AI stated two wrong facts that the team had
  to question: that GitHub issues cannot be deleted (repository owners can
  delete them), and issue counts per repository it had not actually counted.
  Counts and platform facts from the AI must be checked before acting on them.

## 3. Critical evaluation
