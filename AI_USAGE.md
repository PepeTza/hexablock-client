# AI Usage

How the team uses generative AI in this repository, as required by section 7
of the project statement. The team is responsible for all delivered code,
whether or not it was AI-assisted, and must be able to explain any part of it.

## 1. Tools

| Tool | Model / version | Role in the workflow |
|---|---|---|
| Claude (claude.ai) | Claude Opus 5.5 | Requirements analysis, business rules, use cases, domain model, API contract, repository documentation. Consulted for design options; decisions are taken by the team. |
| Claude Code | To be recorded per entry | Implementation of approved tasks through the harness (`harness/`). Writes code and tests under human approval at each gate. |

Add a row when a new tool is used.

### Template

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Task]

- **Tool / model:**
- **Issue / PR:**
- **Prompt (literal or faithful paraphrase):**
- **Result:** what the AI produced (code, design, explanation).
- **Team modifications:** what was changed, rejected or corrected, and why.
- **Lessons / limitations:**
```

### 2026-11-04 to 2026-11-10 — Pre-implementation documentation

- **Tool / model:** Claude (claude.ai), Claude Opus 5.5.
- **Issue / PR:** initial repository skeleton.
- **Prompt (paraphrase):** review the project statement and the team's draft;
  detect inconsistencies; propose and refine requirements, business rules,
  use cases, the DDD model, the class diagram structure, the API contract,
  contribution rules and this repository skeleton, one piece at a time and
  explaining new concepts.
- **Result:** technical document (requirements, rules RN-01..43, use cases
  CU-01..18, user stories, DDD model, decisions), API contract,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the harness and templates.
- **Team modifications:**
  - Business rules corrected by the team (e.g. Hexa Fit score based on moves
    and time, relocation counted as one move, levels immutable and only
    appended).
  - Seed configuration moved to an admin panel after clarification with the
    professor.
  - The AI first proposed squash-and-merge; it was replaced by rebase-and-merge
    because squash would erase the granular, per-author history the statement
    requires.
  - The team chose composition (`Board<TCell>` with an injected geometry)
    among the options presented.
- **Lessons / limitations:** the AI tends to propose more classes and patterns
  than needed; the team keeps only what it can justify. Diagram import into
  Lucidchart lost generic type parameters and had to be fixed manually.

## 3. Critical evaluation
